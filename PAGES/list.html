		Humans have been constructing buildings for thousands of years - from simple huts to grand temples. Buildings are reflective of the world around us, and act as a visual representation of how it is continually changing. As we have evolved, so has the way we approach constructing structures. We are building safer, quicker, taller and larger than ever before, utilising modern methods of construction and a large, skilled workforce. Those who construct buildings gain a real sense of pride from their creations, and this is something we see throughout history. Rather than just places we live, work and shop in, buildings can be monuments, places of worship, cultural hubs and much more. Lets take a look at the best of the best, from tombs built by the ancient Egyptians to modern-day monolithic skyscrapers, here's 20 of the most famous buildings from around the world

		<h2><br>La Sagrada Familia, Barcelona, Spain<br><br></h2>
		<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/13677543/pexels-photo-13677543.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" width="500"/></a>

		<br>
		Originally designed by diocesan architect Francisco de Paula del Villar, the design and building of the temple was taken over by world-famous architect Antoni Gaudi. Though not originally intended to be a cathedral with its iconic towers and combination of Gothic and Art Nouveau style, it is one of the most iconic structures in the world and a testament to Gaudi’s unique architectural style.
		<br>
		<br>
		Construction began in 1882, but the plans were partially destroyed during the Spanish Civil War and much time has been spent trying to piece them back together again. The building is due to be finally completed by 2026, a full century after Gaudí’s death.

		<p>
		<br>
		This list wouldn’t be complete without the most famous piece of leaning architecture.
		<br>
		<br>
		The Leaning Tower of Pisa, whose turbulent construction began in 1173 and continued over 200 years of wars, is one of the truly iconic works of medieval European architecture. Its distinctive lean makes it instantly recognisable; while the 207 columns spaced around its eight stories are make it an astonishing example of Romanesque architecture. Visitors can climb its 297 step spiral staircase to look out over Pisa from the top of the tower.

		<br>
		The Hagia Sophia, which means ‘Holy Wisdom’, has a unique and fascinating history. Originally built from 537 to 1453, it was first a Greek Orthodox church, briefly a Roman Catholic cathedral from 1204 to 1261, then a mosque from 1453 to 1931, until it was secularised and made a museum from 1935 to 2020, reverting back to a mosque.
		<br>
		<br>
		Mirroring the enormous historical, cultural and religious changes of the history of its country, the Hagia Sophia is a truly unique building and a must-visit attraction for those who travel to Turkey.

		<h2><br>Parthenon, Athens, Greece<br><br></h2>

		The Parthenon is a 5th century BC Greek temple which sits atop the hill of the Acropolis in Athens. Dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena Parthenos, the Parthenon was built by the architects Ictinus and Callicrates under the supervision of the sculptor Phidias. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Work began in 447 BC, and the building itself was completed by 438. Although the rectangular white marble Parthenon has suffered damage over the centuries, including the loss of most of its sculpture, its basic structure has remained intact.

		Architecturally famous for its pioneering of the rib vault and flying buttress, the Cathedral has survived wars, revolutions and most recently a massive fire which destroyed much of its interior and its iconic spire but left the main structure intact.

		<h2><br>Petra, Jordan<br><br></h2>

		<p>
		<br>
		Petra is an archaeological and a historical city in the Southern part of Jordan which was known by the locals as Raqmu. It is believed that Petra was established in the early 6th century BC. The settlement could have begun in about 9000 BC in the region. The Nabateans, who constructed Petra, did so because of its proximity to important trade routes in the area.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the 1st century AD, the popular Khazan structure was constructed which is believed to have been the mausoleum of the King of Nabatea, Aretas IV. During the Byzantine period, several churches of Christian faith were built. The significance of the city declined over the years and finally abandoned in the early Muslim era. It was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1985.
